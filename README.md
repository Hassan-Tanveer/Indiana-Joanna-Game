# Game Description
Indiana Joanna is an action-adventure game set in Ancient Egypt. Using her arsenal of whips, bow and arrows and spears, Indiana Joanna must fight her way across the Saharan desert and survive the horde of resurrected mummies. With the fate of humanity lying in her wake, Indiana Joanna needs to collect key historical artefacts to unlock the Pyramid to battle the Pharaoh and seal the crypt shut once and forever.

# Story
Once mourning the death of the Pharaoh, Ancient Egypt now fears the resurrection of their once beloved King. The reawakening of the Pharaoh comes with a curse that has spread across Egypt resurrecting disciples of the past. The Pharaoh’s mummified disciples act on his order to turn civilisation into the living dead and to bring back Egypt’s treasured artefacts to accelerate his curse beyond Egypt.
With no one brave enough to face the fears and step up to fight, Ancient Egypt is in danger of being wiped off the map. An unfamiliar heroine, Indiana Joanna makes herself known fending off the mummies and making it her mission to rescue historical artefacts, lift the curse and bury the Pharaoh.
